# Allowing Color Theme Change

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we let users change the color theme of our product?

## Considered Options

* No - It adds up to the distraction. User shouldn't be focusing on what color theme to choose but rather the timer itself and the tasks on hand.  
* Yes - Makes our product more personalizable, thus more attractive for the user to continue using it.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Yes', because

* Though adding the change color theme may add up to the distraction, it is entirely possible that our default theme is extremely uncomfortable to some eyes due to some medical condition. Thus, having a different color theme will facilitate these users to use our product.
* To limit the distraction aspect, we will not let the user change color themes during an active session so that once in session, the user only focuses on the timer and his tasks and not the color theme.
